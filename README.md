# Satellite-Images-Analysis
satellite imagery data and how it can  be analyzed



Satellite images are part of the big data revolution. These images are captured through remote sensing technologies – 
like drones, aerial photographs and satellite sensors .
 Algorithms refine these data to describe places and phenomena on the Earth’s surface and in the atmosphere.
Satellite images are one of the most powerful and important tools used by the meteorologist.
 They are essentially the eyes in the sky. These images reassure forecasters to the behavior 
of the atmosphere as they give a clear, concise, 
and accurate representation of how events are unfolding.


Goal
We aim to be familiarised with the concept of satellite imagery data and how it can
 be analyzed to investigate real-world environmental and humanitarian challenges.
